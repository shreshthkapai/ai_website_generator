Effortlessly generate fully functional websites with text and image uploads. This AI-powered system automates everything from generating website to deploying it on vercel.


## Features:
1. Gradio Interface: Enter a prompt and upload images (you can give prompts for eeach image u upload as well, if you upload multiple imgaes seperate each image prompt with a ',') with ease.
2. AI-Powered Code Generation: Creates structured, SEO-optimized code dynamically.
3. Automated Validation: Ensures the generated code aligns with the prompt.
4. One-Click Deployment: Instantly deploys to Vercel with no manual setup.
5. Smart Image Handling: AI infers image roles dynamically, no manual resizing required. (Although this feature is not completely robust as of now).
6. Supports Various Website Types: Personal, landing pages, e-commerce, and more (It supports both multi page and single page websites)!


## How it Works:
1. Provide a prompt, enter your website domain name (optional), upload images you want in your website and prompt where you want them (optional).
2. AI generates website code and validates it.'
