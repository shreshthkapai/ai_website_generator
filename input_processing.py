def process_user_input(prompt, image_data, image_prompts):
    structured_prompt = f"""
Based on this user prompt:

{prompt}

Analyze the request carefully and extract structured data **without using hardcoded rules**. Infer content intelligently based on meaning and context.

ðŸ”¹ **ADDITIONAL KEY ANALYSIS**
- **Determine Website Structure**: Identify if the user wants a multi-page website or a single-page website with sections.
  - Look for phrases like "multiple pages", "separate pages", "different pages", or specific page names.
  - If the user mentions different pages by name (e.g., "home page", "contact page"), infer a multi-page structure.
  - Include a "website_structure" field in your response with value "multi-page" or "single-page".
  - For multi-page websites, include a "pages" array with the names of all required pages.
  
ðŸ”¹ **STRICT RULES**  
- **Infer categories logically** (e.g., Work Experience vs. Projects) instead of relying on predefined keywords.  
- **Recognize the website type from the prompt** and structure content accordingly.  
- If all necessary details are provided, **use them exactly** without generating extra content.  
- If details are missing, **fill in gaps naturally based on context** (e.g., an e-commerce site without product details should still generate example products).  

ðŸ”¹ **1. Understand Website Type & Purpose**  
- Identify whether the website is a **portfolio, business, landing page, or e-commerce site** based on the user's prompt.  
- Structure sections accordingly **without requiring explicit section names** from the user.  

ðŸ”¹ **2. Extract & Organize Content Dynamically**  
- **Infer content meaning based on context**, not predefined labels.  
  - Work Experience should contain **career-related details** (e.g., job roles, company names).  
  - Projects should contain **independent work, research, or applications built by the user**.  
  - E-commerce sites should contain **product listings, descriptions, and checkout flows**, even if not explicitly provided.  
- Do not mix up unrelated content.  

ðŸ”¹ **3. Handle Missing Details Intelligently**  
- If a required section (e.g., "Products" for an e-commerce site) is missing, **generate logical placeholders** instead of leaving it blank.  
- If image placements are not specified, **position them naturally based on the content structure**.  

ðŸ”¹ **4. Maintain User-Specified Constraints**  
- If the user provides complete details, **do not add extra information**.  
- Follow any specific requests **exactly as given** (e.g., if a user specifies exact sections, do not modify them).  

Return the response **only as a valid JSON object**, with no extra text.
